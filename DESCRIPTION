Description: Gaussian phylogenetic comparative models represent models of 
  continuous trait data associated with the tips of a phylogenetic tree, under 
  which the distribution of the trait values is multivariate Gaussian. Examples 
  of such models are Gaussian continuous time branching stochastic processes 
  such as Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), which regard the 
  data at the tips of the tree as an observed (final) state of a Markov chain 
  starting from an initial state at the root and evolving along the branches of 
  the tree. The PCMBase R package provides a general framework for manipulating 
  such models. This framework consists of an application programming interface 
  for specifying data and model parameters, and efficient algorithms for 
  simulating trait evolution under a model and calculating the likelihood of 
  model parameters for an assumed model and trait data. The core interface 
  consists of several S3 generic methods (validateModel, mvcond, AbCdEf, Lmr). 
  A model represents an object of an S3 class and specializations of the above 
  methods for this class. These specializations are invoked in the function 
  mvsim simulating trait evolution from an initial trait vector at the root of 
  the tree, and the function mvlik calculating the model likelihood, that is the 
  Gaussian probability density of data observed at the tips of the tree, given 
  an assumedmodel and model parameters. The package implements a growing 
  collection of models, which currently includes BM, OU, BM/OU with jumps, 
  2-speed OU.
