The raw result files from the posterior quantile-test replications are stored in
a separate data-file called 2019-MitovEtAl-TPB.zip. This file can be obtained
upon request from the author. Unzip this file within the PCMBase root directory.
This will populate the sub-directories BM, DOU, JOU, OU, with files named as
Replication*.RData.
