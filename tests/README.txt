The raw result files from the different tests (e.g. benchmark tests, posterior quantile-test replications and AdaptMCMC tests) are stored in
a separate data-file called 2019-MitovEtAl-TPB.zip. This file can be obtained
upon request from the authors. Unzip this file within the PCMBase root directory.
