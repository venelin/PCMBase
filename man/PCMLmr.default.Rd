\usage{
\method{PCMLmr}{default}(X, tree, model, metaI = PCMValidate(tree, model),
  pruneI = PCMPruningOrder(tree), pc = PCMPresentCoordinates(X, tree,
  pruneI), root.only = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a \code{k x N} numerical matrix with possible \code{NA} entries. Each
column of X contains the measured trait values for one species (tip in tree).
Depending on the value of the global option "PCMBase.Internal.PC.Full" \code{NA}
entries are interpreted either as missing measurements or non-existing traits
(see \code{\link{PCMPresentCoordinates}}).}

\item{tree}{a phylo object with N tips.}

\item{model}{an S3 object specifying both, the model type (class, e.g. "OU") as
well as the concrete model parameter values at which the likelihood is to be
calculated (see also Details).}

\item{metaI}{a list returned from a call to \code{PCMValidate(tree, model)},
containing meta-data such as N, M and k.}

\item{pruneI}{a named list containing cached preprocessing data for the tree used
to perform post-order traversal (pruning). By default, this is created
using \code{PCMPruningOrder(tree)}. This will use the default R-implementation of the
likelihood calculation, which is based on the default R-implementation of the
function \code{\link{PCMLmr}} (\code{\link{PCMLmr.default}}) and the S3 specification
of the function
\code{\link{PCMAbCdEf}} for the given model (a function called \code{PCMAbCdEf.MODEL},
where model is the name of the mode and the class attribute of the \code{model}
argument. For a different implementation of the function \code{\link{PCMLmr}},
provide an S3 object for which an S3 specification has been written (see Details
and example section).}

\item{pc}{a logical k x M matrix returned by \code{\link{PCMPresentCoordinates}}.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if some debug-messages should printed.}
}
\value{
A list with the members A,b,C,d,E,f,L,m,r for all nodes in the tree or
  only for the root if root.only=TRUE.

Defaut R-implementation of PCMLmr
}
\details{
This funciton is not a generic S3 implementation of PCMLmr - it needs
additional raguments and is designed to be called by PCMLik. It can still
be called by the end-user for debugging purpose.
